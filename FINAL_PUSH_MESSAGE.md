# Final Push Instructions

Dear user,

Your chat application update is complete. To finalize the process, follow these steps:

1. Open your terminal and navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd /home/user/y
   ```

2. Push the changes to your GitHub repository:
   ```
   git push origin main
   ```

3. If you encounter any issues, you may need to force push:
   ```
   git push -f origin main
   ```
   Note: Use force push cautiously as it can overwrite remote changes.

4. After pushing, follow the instructions in FINAL_STEPS.md to update your local environment and test the new features.

5. If you need any assistance, refer to the documentation files or contact support.

Congratulations on completing the update process!
